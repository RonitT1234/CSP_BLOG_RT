-  Discuss concepts and understanding of Linear Regression algorithms.

Linear regression is a method used to understand the relationship between two variables, where one variable (the independent variable) is used to predict the value of another variable (the dependent variable).

-  Discuss concepts and understanding of Decision Tree analysis algorithms.

n machine learning, a decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model to categorize or predict based on previous questions. The model is trained and tested on data that contains the desired categorization.
