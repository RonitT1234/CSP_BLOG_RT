    "There are a few factors you need to confirm to decide if a system is fault tolerant or not. Think of each device/point as a pool, and the lines as pipes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you were to pour water into any pool, can the other pools access the water? \n",
    "(can data be accessed from all points?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If one pipe were to be cut, can the other pools still access the water? \n",
    "(If a path fails, can data be accessed from all points?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- If one pool is removed, can the other pools still access water from eachother? \n",
    "(If one device fails, can the other points receive data?)\n",
    "\n",
    "If to answer to all of these are \"Yes,\" then the system is Fault Tolerant. \n",

    ">> Redundancy: Fault Tolerant networks typically have extra components and pathways to ensure reliability, making them have redundancy. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> \"Essential Knowledges\" from College Board\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Internet has been engineered to be fault-tolerant, with abstractions for routing and transmitting data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- One way to accomplish network redunadancy is by having more than one path between any to connected devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route if it's possible to reach that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit of fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The redundancy of routing options between 2 points increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to the more devices and more people.\n"

    "- System tasks: Tasks that are done for the operating system, such as managing hardware, network configuration, file management, and security tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- User tasks: Tasks that the user themself has selected, such as running a search engine, opening a video game, and running MS paint. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Not efficient. A computer would use sequential computing if its hardware is limited, or if the tasks requested are dependent on eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Useful because it requires less resources and is easier to manage, and has a lower chance of error compared to parallel computing. \n",
