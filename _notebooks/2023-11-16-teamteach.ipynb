    "\n",
    "Organizations can effectively harness the power of crowdsourcing while mitigating potential drawbacks by getting as much information as possible while minizing the cost to get the data. To reduce risk they could also background check the people who are particiapting in the companies crowdsourcing operation. \n",

    "Identify a real-world example of a successful crowdsourcing project. Explain the project, its goals, and the positive outcomes achieved through the collaboration of a large group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia is a perfect example of crowdsourcing becuase milliions of people all over the world particpated in putting information onto an online information database. The project goal is to gather all the information in the world. The positive outcome achieved throough the collabaration of a large group of people are that everyone has easy access to information online.\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "Create a hypothetical scenario where crowdsourcing could be applied to solve a specific problem. Describe the problem, the type of contributions you would seek from the crowd, and the potential impact of implementing the crowdsourced solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem that crowdsourcing could solve could be the problem that a company doesn't have enough data to train their program on. By using crowdsoucring they could gather lots of information from real people. These people would provide real responses and would really showcase why crowdsorucing is a great solution."
